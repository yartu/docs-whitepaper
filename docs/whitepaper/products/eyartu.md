## eYartu

eYartu is a SaaS service with exactly the same components as Yartu Suite (email, storage, contacts, notes, calendar, conference and project management). eYartu targets end users and small to medium-sized businesses that do not have their own data center.

Businesses that want to use eYartu can transfer their services in a few steps and quickly. Initially, the business becomes a member of the eYartu platform and chooses a suitable package for it. Later on the business completes the migration process by directing the MX records from the domain name management to eYartu. By subscribing to the eYartu platform, end users can use their e-mail addresses with the extension "eyartu.com" and all eYartu applications. eYartu offers end users 1 GB storage space and 1 GB mail space free of charge.
