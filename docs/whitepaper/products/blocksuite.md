## Yartu Block Suite

Yartu is focused on developing applications that ensure data confidentiality, integrity and security for corporate and individual customers. With Yartu Block Suite, these applications have been taken one step further and integrated with blockchain technology.

Yartu Block Suite, while providing e-mail and cloud services integrated with blockchain, also has a wallet feature. This feature allows sending and receiving crypto assets to an e-mail address as the same time as sending and receiving e-mails. Many data on the product can be included in the blockchain network. The ownership of a file stored in your storage, your e-mail, a note you take with the notes application and more can be proven with the capabilities of blockchain technology.

Any data (file, e-mail, note, etc.) kept in Yartu Block Suite can be converted to NFT, its ownership can be guaranteed and transferred to other users. This transfer process can be done via Yartu NFT Market without the need for an additional application.
