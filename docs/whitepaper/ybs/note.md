## YBS Note Service

YBS Note Service is designed to meet the need to store and share notes. It offers two different note-taking methods, sticky notes and notepad.

Sticky notes are developed for quick note taking. It is possible to quickly take notes on each page using its interface. Sticky notes can be pinned, archived, saved as a file to the repository.

Notepad is designed as an environment where users can take notes in a more organized fashion. Each note created in the notebook can be considered as a page. Simple text formatting can be done using a basic text editor. In addition, notes can be enriched by adding features such as picture files and to-do lists. It is possible to share the notebook with other users within certain authorizations (read or read/write). In addition, notebooks can be categorized with specific tags and filtered by these tags.

All created notes can be converted to NFT and put up for sale on Yartu NFT Market.
