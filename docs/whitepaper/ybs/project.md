## YBS Project Service

YBS Project Service; It is a service that uses the KANBAN approach, which provides an environment for companies or institutions to work together as a team, allowing to set up and customize a workflow for meetings, projects and events.

Industry standard practices and methods were used during the development of the service. Users can create as many boards as they want within a project and add any number of work lists to these boards. Project managers can perform functions such as assigning work to teammates, adding due dates to work, tagging work, archiving. Users can also add comments to jobs and add to-do lists.

Thanks to the advanced notification system of YBS Project Service, it sends notifications to users at every stage of the work and the status of the work can be reported. Thanks to the calendar integration, the tasks assigned to the user are automatically processed into the project calendar, which is a special calendar within the user's calendar. Thus, users can see the jobs assigned to them and the due dates of these jobs by looking at their calendar. With the storage integration, the user can add a document in the storage as an attachment to any job.
