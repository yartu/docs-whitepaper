## YBS Office Service

YBS Office Service allows users to edit office files and work simultaneously via web browsers. The most important feature of YBS Office Service is that it allows collaborative work on the file. Users who can access an office file shared with YBS Drive Service can instantly monitor or make changes to the file within their authorization. Therefore, the user can review the work done on the file and add comments. This is very beneficial in documents that need to be worked on collectively.
