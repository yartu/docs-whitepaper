## YBS Directory Service

YBS Directory Service is an application where users can organize their personal directories and label them according to certain criteria. It offers two different guides, general and private guide. A personal directory can be exported or an external directory can be imported. Thanks to CardDav support, it can synchronize with the contacts of mobile phones (suitable for Android, IOS operating system) or any contacts application that supports CardDav.

With the Groups option, a special address book can be created for group members. Address books can be shared with other users with certain authorization. YBS Directory Service works integrated with Yartu E-mail Service. This service can list incoming and outgoing email addresses. It can predict and suggest the person to be sent during e-mail sending.
