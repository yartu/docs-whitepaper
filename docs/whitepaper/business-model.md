## YARTU Token Business Model

YARTU Token is a utility token created for users who want to use Yartu Block Suite.

Services on Yartu Block Suite are limited to certain quotas for free use (Table 3). Apart from the free part, it is necessary to keep YARTU Token in the wallet and spend YARTU Token for capacity usage. Users use the YARTU Token required for services by connecting their wallets through the platform. In cases where there is sufficient amount of YARTU Tokens, they cannot use outside the determined capacity, but they can use the services with their current capacity. They can transfer the YARTU Tokens they have in their wallets to each other.

Yartu Block Suite runs its services over resources on CPU, RAM, disk and network infrastructure. These resources need to be increased and managed according to user needs. Yartu Block Suite rewards investors who contribute to the provision of these resources with YARTU Token revenues from the use of the platform. Investors lock the YARTU Tokens in their hands at certain time intervals by creating liquidity with the Resource Funding Program to create the required resources. During this locking, 50% of the YARTU Token revenues are automatically shared with the investors participating in the Resource Funding Program in proportion to their investments. Locking periods of the Resource Funding Program are determined as 7, 14, 21, 30, 45, 60 and 90 days. Traders who unlock before these times receive staking rewards with a certain penalty point. With this program, despite the increasing number of users, the infrastructure is provided quickly and a sustainable service is provided. The resulting rewards are automatically paid to the wallets of the investors via smart contracts. The minimum YARTU Token amounts to be made to infrastructure resources for the staking program are given in Table 4 (These values ​​may vary according to infrastructure costs).
