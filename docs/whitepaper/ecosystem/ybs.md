## Yartu Block Suite

With Yartu Block Suite, users will be able to individually benefit from all services offered to corporate customers in Yartu Suite. Yartu Block Suite, with its user-friendly design, offers users blockchain based high-level features such as sending and receiving anonymous e-mails, proving the ownership of the produced files, converting the created files to NFT, and also provides quick solutions (word processor, spread sheets, presentation, project management, video conference, contacts management, forms) to the daily needs of the users.

It has been designed using a number of open source projects under the Yartu Block Suite platform. The required services are developed in the microservice architecture. Python, Go, Javascript and C/C++ programming languages were used for development.

Yartu is positioned on the blockchain network to store file hash values (hash values) and other data that should be kept on the blockchain at lower costs. Data on this network can be viewed through a blockchain explorer-like page. During the process of taking ownership of the file by the user, the data will be written on the blockchain network.
