## Yartu Block Suite Ecosystem

The services on the Yartu Block Suite are positioned as on-chain and off-chain according to the place of use. Unlike other blockchain projects, Yartu Block Suite is designed with a hybrid model rather than a purely on-chain approach. In this way, communication between people using conventional e-mail and storage services and blockchain technology will be possible with Yartu Block Suite. With all these features, Yartu Block Suite combines the product world with the unique features of the blockchain world, allowing users to use blockchain technology for their daily needs.

Yartu Block Suite offers an ecosystem that combines innovative products and services needed by the real sector and crypto world by using blockchain technology and operates it with YARTU Token. It includes Yartu Block Suite, Yartu Block Suite Access Account, Yartu Block Suite Wallet, Yartu NFT Market and blockchain platform, which can be accessed via mobile and web applications within the ecosystem (Figure 6). It contains services or subcomponents that may be needed within each platform.
