## Yartu Block Suite Access Account

For each account on Yartu Block Suite, a private key and a public address are identified, similar to other blockchain projects. Each account created on the blockchain network is potentially a Yartu Block Suite user.

A user who wants to log in to Yartu Block Suite or create a new account can access his account by logging in with **Yartu Block Suite Wallet** after accessing the platform through the website.

Users who want to benefit from the services on the system should activate their accounts by paying with a certain amount of YARTU Token. This payment is mandated to protect the network from sending spam emails and creating fake accounts. Users who do not have an account on the blockchain network before can create an account quickly through the interface and back up their private keys.
