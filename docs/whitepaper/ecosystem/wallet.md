## Yartu Block Suite Wallet

Yartu Block Suite Wallet is a digital wallet that allows users and investors to save and manage YARTU Tokens along with other cryptocurrencies. Thanks to this wallet, each user will have their own personal wallet and will be able to transact on the blockchain network with very low fees. Every user who activates his account will be able to use Yartu Block Suite as a wallet.

In Yartu Block Suite, Yartu Block Suite Wallet is used for data transactions made on the blockchain network, such as defining the e-mail address as a wallet alias, uniqueizing any file or note in the repository. YARTU Token must be paid for these transactions. No payment is required for data transactions to be made on the blockchain network that will be created by Yartu. In addition, Yartu Block Suite Wallet is used for account costs or expenditures within the Yartu NFT Market.

A web browser plug-in will be developed within the scope of Yartu Block Suite. With this plugin, users will be able to securely log into their wallets. A token will be generated with OAuth2.0 for the user as soon as he/she logs into the Yartu Block Suite platform using their private key with the add-on. After this process, there will be no need to log in again for off-chain transactions, all transactions will be carried out through this token.

When the user wants to send YARTU Token or one of the other assets to another wallet through their wallet, they will need to confirm it by logging in again through the plugin.

In order to take ownership of any file and information (document, note, e-mail, etc.) created on Yartu Block Suite or any uploaded file, the hash value of the relevant file must be written to the blockchain network. For this process, the user will still need to confirm via the plugin.
