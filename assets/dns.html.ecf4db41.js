The job of YNS is to match human-readable names such as “alice.yartu” with machine-readable identifiers such as BSC addresses, addresses of other blockchains (e.g., Ethereum, Bitcoin, Ripple), content hashes, and metadata. YNS also supports &quot;reverse resolution&quot;, which allows metadata such as canonical names or interface descriptions to be associated with BSC addresses. YNS has the same goals as DNS, the Internet Domain Name Service, but has a completely different architecture due to the capabilities and limitations offered by the Binance blockchain. Like DNS, YNS operates on a system of dotted hierarchical names called domains, with the domain owner having full control over sub-domains. Top-level domains such as &quot;.dns&quot; and &quot;.test&quot; are owned by smart contracts called registrars that set rules for assigning their sub-domains. Anyone can acquire ownership of a domain for their own use by following the rules set out in these agreements with the registrar. Because of the hierarchical nature of YNS, anyone who owns a domain at any level can set up sub-domains—for themselves or others—as they see fit. For example, if Bob owns bob.yartu, he can create pay.bob.yartu and customize it however he wants.</p><p>In YNS, the list of data to be stored in a domain is summarized in the Figure 3.</p><p><img src="'+o+'" alt="List of Domain Data"></p><p><strong>Figure 3.</strong> List of Domain Data</p><p>YNS has two principal components: the registry, and resolvers.</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="YNS: Registrar and Resolvers"></p><p><strong>Figure 4.</strong> YNS: Registrar and Resolvers</p><p>The YNS registry consists of a single smart contract that stores a list of all domains and sub-domains, and stores three important pieces of information about each:</p><ul><li><p>Domain owner,</p></li><li><p>Domain Resolver,</p></li><li><p>Caching lifetime for all records in the domain.</p></li></ul><p>The domain owner can be either an external account (a user) or a smart contract. A registrar is simply a smart contract that owns a domain and issues sub-domains of that domain to users who follow certain rules defined in the contract. Registrants in the YNS registry can:</p><ul><li><p>Install a resolver and TTL for the domain</p></li><li><p>Transfer of ownership of a domain to another address</p></li><li><p>Change the owner of sub-domains</p></li></ul><p>The YNS registry is intentionally simple and exists only to associate a name with the resolver responsible for it. Resolvers are responsible for the actual process of converting names to addresses. Any contract that implements the relevant standards can act as a resolver in YNS. Each record type - crypto address, IPFS content hash, etc. - defines the method or methods that the resolver must implement to serve records of that type. Name resolution in YNS is a two-step process: first, you ask the registry which resolver is responsible for the name, and second, you ask that resolver to answer your query.</p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt="Query a Yartu Domain"></p><p><strong>Figure 5.</strong> Query a Yartu Domain</p>',15),l=[c];function h(d,m){return a(),t("div",null,l)}const u=e(i,[["render",h],["__file","dns.html.vue"]]);export{u as default};
